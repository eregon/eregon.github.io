  <div class="post-line"></div>

  

  <p>Bundler 2 did not arrive quietly.
It was noticed by almost every CI build failing when running <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code>.
As a result, it seems many still avoid Bundler 2 and just use Bundler 1.
In this post, I present some ideas on how to get more people to use Bundler 2,
and no longer need Bundler 1 which will not be maintained forever.</p>

<h2 id="the-rubygems-requirement-of-bundler-2">The RubyGems Requirement of Bundler 2</h2>

<p>The original release of Bundler 2, which is version 2.0.0, <a href="https://bundler.io/blog/2019/01/03/announcing-bundler-2.html">required such a
recent RubyGems version</a>
that none of the released Ruby versions had a recent enough RubyGems version shipped with them.
Bundler 2 also requires Ruby 2.3+, and finally drops support for Ruby 1.8.</p>

<p>This RubyGems version requirement was quickly found as problematic, and as a result Bundler 2.0.1 was released
to lower the RubyGems version requirement to RubyGems 2.5.
All versions of Ruby supported by Bundler 2 (that is, Ruby 2.3+) ship with RubyGems 2.5 or newer, but the <a href="https://bundler.io/blog/2019/01/04/an-update-on-the-bundler-2-release.html">blog post</a> did not make this clear.</p>

<p>This resulted in a lot of confusion. Most repositories ended up explicitly
updating RubyGems in CI to make Bundler 2.0.0 work, as mentioned in the original blog post.</p>

<p>To summarize, <strong>it is not needed to update RubyGems to use Bundler 2.0.1+</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact, I would even argue against updating RubyGems in CI because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It makes the CI slower.</li>
  <li>It makes the CI less reliable by frequently changing the RubyGems version used.</li>
  <li>It uses the latest RubyGems instead of the well known version bundled with that Ruby version.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bundler-version-autoswitching">Bundler Version Autoswitching</h2>

<p>Bundler 2 came with another feature, which to say the least is very confusing.
This feature is actually implemented directly in RubyGems and it unfortunately included a bug,
which led to even <a href="https://bundler.io/blog/2019/05/14/solutions-for-cant-find-gem-bundler-with-executable-bundle.html">more confusion</a>.</p>

<p>Supposing you have both Bundler 1.17.2 and Bundler 2.0.2 installed, what should this print?</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ bundle --version
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For every other gem, the answer would be the latest version of the gem installed, so in this case 2.0.2.</p>

<p>The actual answer though, due to Bundler version autoswitching is “it depends on many things”.
Specifically, if the current directory or any parent directory has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> file with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH</code> section,
then that exact version, or the closest version with the same major version (depending on the RubyGems version), will be used. If such a version is not available, it fails with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Could not find 'bundler' (&lt;VERSION&gt;)</code> (e.g., when only Bundler 2 is installed with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH 1.17.2</code>).</p>

<p>Otherwise, if there is no <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> in the current directory or any parent directory, <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle</code> behaves like a normal gem and uses the latest version.</p>

<p>As an example, this feature means that as long as there is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH 1.x</code>,
even if Bundler 2 is installed, Bundler 1 would be used, or the error above would be shown.</p>

<p>I think this “feature” is so confusing that it should be considered a bug.
It’s counter-intuitive and prevents using Bundler 2 on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH 1.x</code>.</p>

<h2 id="the-migration-problem">The Migration Problem</h2>

<p>The problem I see with all this is I think very few people use Bundler 2, and rather they just keep using Bundler 1.
I tried to estimate how often Bundler 2 is used by various means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I made a <a href="https://twitter.com/eregontp/status/1188046284919332864">poll</a> on Twitter but that got rather few responses, with rather surprising results.</li>
  <li>Some usage statistics from RubyGems.org show that Bundler 2 is only used in about 2% of requests to RubyGems.org.</li>
  <li>TravisCI seems to currently use Bundler 1 <a href="https://travis-ci.org/eregon/mspec/builds/600094360">for every Ruby version</a>.</li>
  <li>Most Ruby projects I have seen with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> are <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH 1.x</code>, showing Bundler 1 is used.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, Bundler 1 seems no longer maintained (which is fair enough, who would want to maintain Ruby 1.8 compatibility?) and likely will no longer receive bug fixes and security patches.</p>

<p>So it is important that Rubyists migrate to Bundler 2,
but I think the current situation made it so inconvenient that very few did.
To address those concerns, I propose some ideas below to make migration to Bundler 2 easier.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-migration-path-for-bundler-2">A Better Migration Path for Bundler 2+</h2>

<p>Here are my suggestions to make migration to Bundler 2 easier.
I think it would be good to integrate them in future Bundler releases, including 2.x releases.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do not require a RubyGems version newer than what Ruby versions supported by Bundler ship.
  Requiring to update RubyGems causes many troubles as seen wth Bundler 2.0.0.</li>
  <li>Drop the version autoswitching mechanism in RubyGems for Bundler entirely. For older RubyGems versions with autoswitching, do whatever is necessary in Bundler to avoid that behavior, or at least warn.</li>
  <li>Every future version of Bundler should support previous versions of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code>.</li>
  <li>Do not modify the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> if there would be no other change than the <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH</code> version (e.g., for <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code> with an existing up-to-date <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>This third point about backward compatibility might require extra maintenance work in Bundler.
However, I think almost every software of the scale of Bundler needs to do this kind of things,
and I would expect keeping a few extra parsers for older formats of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> is not so much work.
For instance, even in Bundler 10, I expect installing gems from an already-resolved <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> is basically just installing every listed gem with the listed version.
Why <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> and not just <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code>? Because Bundler evaluates the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> in all cases in its current design.</p>

<p>I think supporting older <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> is the key for more people to adopt newer versions of Bundler.
And importantly, this is the only way people can use newer versions of Bundler and stop using unmaintained and old Bundler versions for existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> files with <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH 1.x</code> (not all <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> will be migrated immediately to Bundler 2).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I shared these suggestions with the Bundler team in October 2019 and they generally agreed and already discussed these subjects at RubyKaigi 2019.</p>

<p>Some of the suggestions listed above have already been addressed.
For instance, the RubyGems version requirement (#1) was fixed in 2.0.1, one day after the 2.0.0 release.</p>

<p>The latest RubyGems and Bundler 2 can actually already install a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH 1.x</code> (#3), but it unfortunately changes the <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH</code> section for seemingly no reason (#4 not yet). This can be seen on 2.7.0-preview2:</p>

<pre>
$ chruby 2.7.0-preview2
$ bundle _2.1.0.pre.2_ install
...
<span style="color: GoldenRod">Warning: the lockfile is being updated to Bundler 2,
after which you will be unable to return to Bundler 1.</span>
<span style="color: green">Bundle complete! 2 Gemfile dependencies, 7 gems now installed.
Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.</span>
$ git diff
<span style="color: red">---</span> Gemfile.lock
<span style="color: green">+++</span> Gemfile.lock
 BUNDLED WITH
<span style="color: red">-   1.17.2</span>
<span style="color: green">+   2.1.0.pre.2</span>
</pre>

<p>That changes is annoying.
Suppose I’m contributing to Rails and I’m just doing <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code> (without modifying any <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code>).
If this changes the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> I will have to constantly undo that change, or be careful to not commit it and keep a dirty working tree.
If it is committed and merged, it would force every single contributor of Rails (and the CI) to use Bundler 2 once they pull that change.
And every such contributor, when doing <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code> on their own projects would also see the <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH</code> version updated, making this a cascading effect.
That sounds to me like a recipe for a really not smooth migration forcing everyone to update in a really short time, so that’s why I think Bundler should not touch the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> if there would be no other change than the <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH</code> version (#4).</p>

<p>On the other hand, it seems fine to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUNDLED WITH 2.x</code> if there is no <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> or the dependencies need to be re-resolved due to, e.g., adding a gem, since Bundler 2 might resolve gems differently than Bundler 1.</p>

<p>So #1 and #3 seem mostly done for the latest 2.x release, but #2 and #4 are not yet addressed.</p>

<p>Does that sound like a good migration plan to you?</p>

<p>Would you be willing to help making these changes in Bundler and RubyGems?</p>
